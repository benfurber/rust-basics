Learning rust in the open. Committing everything I learn, big and small.

## Current focus

[Working through the main language book.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

## Random things I'm finding interesting

> Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.
